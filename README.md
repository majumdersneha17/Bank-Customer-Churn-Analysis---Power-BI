# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis---Power-BI
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize customer churn behavior in a banking environment. This end-to-end project offers actionable insights for reducing churn, improving customer retention, and identifying high-risk segments based on historical data.


## 📊 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to identify **why customers are leaving the bank**, uncover key drivers of churn, and provide data-driven recommendations to **improve customer retention**. The dashboard allows stakeholders to:

- Monitor churn trends over time
- Analyze customer demographics and behaviors
- Identify high-risk customers for proactive retention strategies

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, visualizations, DAX calculations, and dashboard design
- **DAX**: For creating custom measures and KPIs
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation
- **Excel / CSV / Database** *(assumed)*: As the source of the customer dataset

---

## 📌 Key Features

### 1. **Customer Segmentation**
- Interactive slicers to filter by:
  - Geography (Country, State)
  - Gender
  - Age Group
  - Account Balance Ranges
  - Credit Score

### 2. **Churn Analysis**
- Total Churned vs Retained Customers
- Churn Rate by Gender, Age Group, Geography
- High Churn Segments (e.g., low balance, high tenure)

### 3. **KPIs & Metrics**
- Churn Rate %
- Average Balance of Churned Customers
- Tenure of Customers before Churn
- % of Active vs Inactive Customers

---

## 📈 Business Insights Derived

- **Younger customers** with lower account balances and credit scores showed higher churn rates.
- **Females** exhibited a slightly higher churn rate than males.
- Customers with **tenure between 3–6 years** had increased likelihood of churn, suggesting a critical retention period.
- **Low engagement (low activity score)** was a strong indicator of potential churn.

---

## 🔁 Recommendations

- Launch targeted campaigns for **medium-tenure customers**.
- Offer **balance-based incentives** to customers with low average balances.
- Develop **regional retention strategies** based on churn hotspots.
- Improve **customer support and loyalty programs** for high-risk segments.
